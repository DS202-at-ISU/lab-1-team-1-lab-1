# Lab report #1

Follow the instructions posted at https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html for the lab assignment. The work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file to your repository.  

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for grading once the due date is passed.
Submit a link to your repository on Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that you are done with your submission.

12.3: no errors on my part, RStudio was successfully connected to git and created the new local branch with no problems

12.4: Once again, no errors on my part. easy enough to stage and commit by following the instructions using the stage and commit buttons in the top right then entering the message and hitting commit again in the pop up window

12.5: I had no errors with the push because I did it first for the team, Ethan had a merge conflict that had to be resolved following his attempt. Simply removed the error lines, pulled again the pushed to git.

12.6: Once the merge conflict was resolved there were no issues on github, commits were there for both of us meaning successful start.
